## Introduction

GitHub Action that automatically adds some files and commits them in preparation of a push to a remote. This Action is designed for use with an Action such as [github-push-action](https://github.com/ad-m/github-push-action) as the following step.

## Usage

Add this to your `main.yml` file (or whatever your workflow is called).

```yaml
name: my-workflow

on: [push]

jobs:
  autocommit:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@master
      # Do something here, pre-stage.
      - uses: autosuite/autocommit@master
        with:
          commit-message: Your custom commit message here.
          add-options: -A
      - uses: ad-m/github-push-action@master
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```
